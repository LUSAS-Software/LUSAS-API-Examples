## ‚öôÔ∏èSetting up Python on Windows

You can first check if Python is already installed on your system through one of the following methods:

1. **Using Command Prompt**:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd` and press Enter (this opens the command prompt)
   - Type `python --version` or `python -V` and press Enter
   - If Python is installed, you'll see the version number (like "Python 3.13.3")
   - You can also try `py --version` as an alternative
2. **From the Start Menu**:
   - Search for "Python" in your Start menu
   - If Python is installed, you should see it listed

To **install Python** on your system, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**:
   
   - Download a Python installer from [python.org](https://python.org), preferably v3.13.*
   
   - During installation, make sure to **check "Add Python to PATH"**
   
   - Complete the installation process

2. Install required Python **libraries**:
   
   - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd` and press Enter (this opens the command prompt)
   
   - Run the following command to install pywin32 and ipykernel (default kernel used by Jupyter Notebooks)
      ```bash
      pip install pywin32==308 ipykernel
      ```
   
   - Optionally, additional Python libraries used across the repository examples can be installed running:
      ```bash
      pip install pandas openpyxl matplotlib numpy
      ```

## ‚öôÔ∏èSetting up Jupyter Notebook on Windows

Ensure that Python is already installed on your system, then follow these steps:

**Install Jupyter Notebook**:

- Press `Win + R`, type `cmd` and press Enter (this opens the command prompt)

- Run:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

- If you get a `pip not recognized` error, try:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install notebook
   ```

## üöÄ How to Run

#### Visual Studio Code

The easiest way to run Jupyter Notebook scripts is by opening the with *Visual Studio Code*. Each code block can be executed by the run shortcut ‚ñ∂Ô∏è next to them. It is advised that all code blocks are run from top to bottom.

You will need to install the following VSCode plugins:

- `Python` plugin (released by *Microsoft*)

- `jupyter` plugin (released by *Microsoft*)

- Optionally, `Pylance` plugin (released by *Microsoft*)

#### Manually

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

- In Command Prompt, run: `jupyter notebook`
- Your browser should open automatically with Jupyter running
- The notebook will run at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)

##### Using Anaconda:

If you prefer a more comprehensive scientific Python environment:

1. Download and install Anaconda from [anaconda.com](https://anaconda.com)
2. After installation, launch "Anaconda Navigator"
3. Click on the Jupyter Notebook tile to launch it

## Convert Jupyter Notebooks to Python scripts

If you want to convert your Jupyter Notebooks to Python scripts, you can do so through the `nbconvert` library:

1. Install the library:
   ```bash
   pip install nbconvert
   ```

2. Convert your script: (use your notebook filename instead of `myNotebook.ipynb`)
   ```bash
   jupyter nbconvert --to script myNotebook.ipynb
   ```
   To convert all notebooks within a folder, the following command can be used:
   ```bash
   jupyter nbconvert --to script *.ipynb
   ```
