# LUSAS API (LPI) Examples

This repository provides practical and minimal examples of using the LUSAS Programming Interface (LPI) in Python, VBScript, Jupyter, and C#.

These examples are tailored for **LUSAS v21.1** (see repository branches for other versions).

## What is LUSAS?

[LUSAS](https://www.lusas.com/) is a powerful finite element analysis software used for structural, bridge, geotechnical, and general engineering simulation. The **LUSAS Programming Interface (LPI)** allows automation of model generation, material assignment, loading, solving, and result extraction (read more about it [on the website](https://www.lusas.com/products/information/lusas_programmable_interface.html)).

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- `python/` ‚Äì Python examples
- `jupyter_notebook/` ‚Äì Python code blocks notebooks
- `vbscript/` ‚Äì Legacy examples in VBScript (default LUSAS command bar language)
- `dotnet/` ‚Äì .NET interop examples (C# & VB.NET)
- `grasshopper/` ‚Äì Rhinoceros Grasshopper examples

¬†¬†¬†¬†Browse each directory to read more about each interaction method.

¬†¬†¬† Beginners are recommended to start with `jupyter_notebook` since its interactive nature allows for step-by-step code execution, immediate result display and have ability to combine `python` code, text, and visualizations in a single document.

## Prerequisites

- Installed LUSAS v22+
  
  Most scripts will work with the free [evaluation licence](https://www.lusas.com/evaluation/index.html), however the use of a full or [academic](https://www.lusas.com/academic/index.html) licence is recommended.

  The latest LUSAS installer can be found [at the downloads section](https://www.lusas.com/user_area/download/index.html) of the official website.
- For Python and Jupyter Notebook examples:
  - Installed Python (v3+)
- For C# examples:
  - Visual Studio 2019
- For Grasshopper examples:
  - Rhinoceros (v8.08 or later)
  - Grasshopper LUSAS plugin

¬†¬†¬†¬†For step by step installation guides, see each relevant directory.
