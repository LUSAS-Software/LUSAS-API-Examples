	Represents a set of units, with reference to the default SI units "N m kg C s". This is represented as a conversion factor for each of the five physical quantities: force, length, mass, time and temperature. The factor is a multiplier to convert from one default SI unit to the required units. For example, if the required units are kiloNewtons, there are 0.001 kiloNewtons to one Newton and so the conversion factor is 0.001. Similarly, if the required units are feet, there are 3.281 feet to one metre, and so the conversion factor is 3.281 Unit sets are created using the function IFModeller.createUnitSet

		Returns how many 'rows' of the given value exist within this attribute. Generally, rows represent rows in grids in the LUSAS Modeller user interface. Some attributes (slidelines and most materials) use rows to represent temperature dependence, with each row representing one temperature. Other attributes use rows for multiple versions of similar data, such as in discrete loads and some variations. Many simple attributes do not use rows at all, and will return 0 for all variables. Similarly, attributes that are row-based may have some values that are nonetheless not row-based, and are "shared" between all rows. This function will also return 0 for those values. 
 If this function returns 0, IFAttribute.getValue and IFAttribute.setValue should be called without the optional 'row' argument, or with it set to -1. If this function returns 1 or more, IFAttribute.getValue and IFAttribute.setValue will require the extra 'row' argument which should be in the range (0..nrows-1).
 Note that many values are implemented as arrays, whether or not they are present in rows. The only way to discover whether a particular value is row-based or array-based (or both) is to call both IFAttribute.countRows and IFAttribute.getValue

LUSAS will not use this value for any purpose, but will store it in model files, and allow subsequent modification with IFAttribute.setValue and/or subsequent access with IFAttribute.getValue. The value may have any simple data type - integer, boolean, real or string, or it may be a LUSAS LPI object representing an attribute. Or it may be an array of any of these. Note that arrays cannot mix types - e.g. you can have an array of strings OR an array of booleans, but you cannot have an array that contains both strings and booleans, and similarly for all other types. For numbers, it will often be desirable, but is not compulsory, to attach unit information to the value, such that its value can be fetched or modified in a known system of units. This is done using the six optional integers. The integers represent the indices, or 'power' of each scalar quantity - e.g. 2=squared,3=cubed and so on. Each integer may be positive or negative. E.g. specifying '0,0,1,0,0,0' would mean that the new quantity is a length; '0,0,2,0,0,0' would mean length squared, i.e. area; '0,0,1,0,-1,0' would mean length divided by time, i.e. velocity; and '0,1,-2,0,0,0' would mean force per unit area.

By default, values that are added via createValue() are not persistent.

However, the persist flag may be set true to prevent this. This should only be done for data that cannot be logically invalidated by entering conflicting data in Modeller's user interface. For example, attaching a persistent value for "B" and "D" to an RSS attribute would be dangerous, as the end user is free to modify the values of A, Iyy etc, thus making an inconsistent set of values.

We are not returning assignments that are MADE in this given loadcase, but assignments that APPLY in the given loadcase. e.g. Consider that "this" material is assigned only to a particular line in LC1 and then a different material is assigned to the same line in LC4. Just like getAssignments(), when we ask for assignments in LC1, of course we get the assignment to that line. But with this function, when we ask for assignments in LC2, we also get the same return value (the earlier assignment still applies). When we ask for assignments in LC3, we still get the same, for the same reason. When we ask for assignments of this attribute in LC4, we get an empty array - because the line now has the other material assigned.

The value may have any simple data type - integer, boolean, real or string, or it may be a LUSAS LPI object representing an attribute. Or it may be an array of any of these. Note that arrays cannot mix types - e.g. you can have an array of strings OR an array of booleans, but you cannot have an array that contains both strings and booleans, and similarly for all other types. For numbers, it will often be desirable, but is not compulsory, to attach unit information to the value, such that its value can be fetched or modified in a known system of units. This is done using the six optional integers. The integers represent the indices, or 'power' of each scalar quantity - e.g. 2=squared,3=cubed and so on. Each integer may be positive or negative. E.g. specifying '0,0,1,0,0,0' would mean that the new quantity is a length; '0,0,2,0,0,0' would mean length squared, i.e. area; '0,0,1,0,-1,0' would mean length divided by time, i.e. velocity; and '0,1,-2,0,0,0' would mean force per unit area.

LUSAS will not use this value for any purpose, but will store it in model files, and allow subsequent modification with IFLoadset.setValue and/or subsequent access with IFLoadset.getValue. The value may have any simple data type - integer, boolean, real or string, or it may be a LUSAS LPI object representing an attribute. Or it may be an array of any of these. Note that arrays cannot mix types - e.g. you can have an array of strings OR an array of booleans, but you cannot have an array that contains both strings and booleans, and similarly for all other types. For numbers, it will often be desirable, but is not compulsory, to attach unit information to the value, such that its value can be fetched or modified in a known system of units. This is done using the six optional integers. The integers represent the indices, or 'power' of each scalar quantity - e.g. 2=squared,3=cubed and so on. Each integer may be positive or negative. E.g. specifying '0,0,1,0,0,0' would mean that the new quantity is a length; '0,0,2,0,0,0' would mean length squared, i.e. area; '0,0,1,0,-1,0' would mean length divided by time, i.e. velocity; and '0,1,-2,0,0,0' would mean force per unit area. 
		Params:

		Set the lower order feature type for definition commands. This setting allows geometry creation commands to know which data you wish to use to define geometry. For example if points, lines and surfaces are all present in the object set, you can choose which are used to define a volume - depending on which is selected, you may get a very different shape! Note that, if not explicitly specified, the default type depends on the contents of the object on which the creation function is called, as well as the other functions that have been called on "this" data object.
 For example, imagine you have 4 points in the database, 2 of them are selected and additionally some coordinates have been added to "this" data object, then by default:
 IFModeller.database.IFDatabaseOperations.createLine(data) will attempt to create a line passing through all 4 points

class IFResultsComponentSet(IFDispatch):
	"""
	A container for a set of single results components. E.g. for a 2d beam, "Fx", "Fy", and "Mz" would form one 'set'. Other 'sets' may contain principals, equivalents, wood-armer, etc. May store Gauss point, internal point, nodal, element nodal, and/or inspection location results. The results are logically contained within a loadcase, a transformation, an entity, and (for envelopes) a primary component. It is possible (and typical) to store multiple related components within the same component object. For example, all Wood Armer results would typically reside within the same object.
 Please note that the calling conventions of these subroutines prohibit their use in VBScript and other similar languages that require weakly typed (VARIANT) arguments. VARIANTS can lead to slow performance, whereas higher languages (such as VB.NET) can exploit the strongly typed arguments, and gain a speed advantage. Please use the older IFNode.getResults and similar functions for VBScript and similar languages.
 Note that the results within an IFResultsComponentSet are "captured" at a particular moment in time and do not update in response to changes to the current view, or the IFResultsContext that was used to create those results.
 For example, you can create a IFResultsContext, use it to create an IFResultsComponentSet, and inquire the results. You can then change the active loadcase in that context, and the results in the IFResultsComponentSet DO NOT CHANGE. Thus, you can use that context to create another IFResultsComponentSet, which are from the newly active loadcase, and compare the two different sets of results.
 This is quite natural and logical when using the functions herein, but could perhaps be confusing if you pass an IFResultsComponentSet object to functions like IFNode.getResults.
 Deleting the context that was used to create the IFResultsComponentSet does not delete the IFResultsComponentSet. Results for all elements in an IFResultsComponentSet object remain cached, using up quite a lot of memory, until that IFResultsComponentSet object is released, for example (in VBScript) by setting the last pointer to "nothing", or (in .NET) by forcing the garbage collection using FinalReleaseComObject.

The value may have any simple data type - integer, boolean, real or string, or it may be a LUSAS LPI object representing an attribute. Or it may be an array of any of these. Note that arrays cannot mix types - e.g. you can have an array of strings OR an array of booleans, but you cannot have an array that contains both strings and booleans, and similarly for all other types. For numbers, it will often be desirable, but is not compulsory, to attach unit information to the value, such that its value can be fetched or modified in a known system of units. This is done using the six optional integers. The integers represent the indices, or 'power' of each scalar quantity - e.g. 2=squared,3=cubed and so on. Each integer may be positive or negative. E.g. specifying '0,0,1,0,0,0' would mean that the new quantity is a length; '0,0,2,0,0,0' would mean length squared, i.e. area; '0,0,1,0,-1,0' would mean length divided by time, i.e. velocity; and '0,1,-2,0,0,0' would mean force per unit area.

class IFObjectSet(IFDatabaseOperations):
	"""
	A generic set, which remembers a list of IFDatabaseMember objects. The list can be added to and removed from in a variety of ways at any time. A set can be regarded as a temporary group that does not have a name and does not appear in the group treeview. Within Modeller itself, all selections, visible sets, results sets, groups and even the database itself are implemented in this way. Therefore the functionality here is equally applicable to all these objects  
In its most simple usage, the script programmer can simply add, say, a surface and two lines to a set. The set can then be used, for example, to assign attributes, or as a convenient way of grouping the three items together for any other purpose.  
The real power of the sets though is their ability to interpret many forms of input, and derive a list of objects to be added or removed based on that input. For example, adding a concentrated load attribute will actually add all the objects to which that concentrated load attribute is assigned. Adding another set or group adds all the members of that set or group. So to select all the members of a group, the line 'selection.add(group)' is used. Similarly adding the element type 'HX20' will actually add all elements of type HX20.  
Additionally the input may be 'filtered' by object type, name, and ID. So, for example, 'selection.add("HX20", "volume", "1T10") will first identify all the elements of type HX20. Then it will find their parent volumes. Finally, only volumes with IDs between 1 and 10 will actually be selected.  
For complete control, all the functionality described above works for the 'add', 'remove', 'keep', 'delete', 'exists', 'count' and 'getObjects' functions in exactly the same way.  
As well as interacting with Modeller's own intrinsic set objects, the script programmer is free to create temporary set objects for any reason at any time. Use IFModeller.newObjectSet to create such a set. Note that if you create a temporary set, it is your responsibility to maintain the integrity of any objects stored in it. I.e. if you add an object to a temporary set and then delete the object, the set will still contain a reference to that deleted item, and this may cause some operations to fail. It is therefore your responsibility to remember to remove objects any temporary sets that you have created before such objects are deleted. Modeller does this job for you for the intrinsic sets that it knows about (visible, selection, groups, etc).

 Note that this function will raise an error if it unable to find a single value at this node - this could happen for many reasons, including asking for the reactions of an unsupported node or for an average value at a discontinuity caused by (for example) a change of material.
 Thus, it is recommended that IFNode.hasResults() is used to verify that a single value does indeed exist. If an IFUnitSet object (or its name) is given, the value will be returned in those units. Otherwise it will be returned in the database's current unit system.
 Note that for efficiency the requested results are cached and will not be removed from the system (and so will potentially use a large amount of memory) until explicitly removed with a call to IFDatabase.flushScriptedResults

		Creates a new value within this object for subsequent use. The initial value will be 0.0 until modified by a call to IFGroup.setValue. LUSAS will not use this value for any purpose, but will store it in model files, and allow subsequent modification with IFGroup.setValue and/or subsequent access with IFGroup.getValue. The value may have any simple data type - integer, boolean, real or string, or it may be a LUSAS LPI object representing an attribute. Or it may be an array of any of these. Note that arrays cannot mix types - e.g. you can have an array of strings OR an array of booleans, but you cannot have an array that contains both strings and booleans, and similarly for all other types. For numbers, it will often be desirable, but is not compulsory, to attach unit information to the value, such that its value can be fetched or modified in a known system of units. This is done using the six optional integers. The integers represent the indices, or 'power' of each scalar quantity - e.g. 2=squared,3=cubed and so on. Each integer may be positive or negative. E.g. specifying '0,0,1,0,0,0' would mean that the new quantity is a length; '0,0,2,0,0,0' would mean length squared, i.e. area; '0,0,1,0,-1,0' would mean length divided by time, i.e. velocity; and '0,1,-2,0,0,0' would mean force per unit area. 
		Params:
			varNname (str): name of the new value
			energy (int, optional): energy component of the new value (default 0.0)

For numbers, it will often be desirable, but is not compulsory, to attach unit information to the value, such that its value can be fetched or modified in a known system of units. This is done using the six optional integers. The integers represent the indices, or 'power' of each scalar quantity - e.g. 2=squared,3=cubed and so on. Each integer may be positive or negative. E.g. specifying '0,0,1,0,0,0' would mean that the new quantity is a length; '0,0,2,0,0,0' would mean length squared, i.e. area; '0,0,1,0,-1,0' would mean length divided by time, i.e. velocity; and '0,1,-2,0,0,0' would mean force per unit area. 
		Params:
			varNname (str): name of the new value
			energy (int, optional): energy component of the new value (default 0.0)
			force (int, optional): force component of the new value (default 0.0)

The value may have any simple data type - integer, boolean, real or string, or it may be a LUSAS LPI object representing an attribute. Or it may be an array of any of these. Note that arrays cannot mix types - e.g. you can have an array of strings OR an array of booleans, but you cannot have an array that contains both strings and booleans, and similarly for all other types. For numbers, it will often be desirable, but is not compulsory, to attach unit information to the value, such that its value can be fetched or modified in a known system of units.

E.g. specifying '0,0,1,0,0,0' would mean that the new quantity is a length; '0,0,2,0,0,0' would mean length squared, i.e. area; '0,0,1,0,-1,0' would mean length divided by time, i.e. velocity; and '0,1,-2,0,0,0' would mean force per unit area.

	def createUndoableEvent(self, command, undoCommand, description) -> None:
		r"""
		To be used by user dialogs to create named events which are repetitively undoable and redoable. E.g. a dialog might create two discrete loads to represent a pedestrian. The dialog would probably issue two commands of the form "db.createLoadingDiscretePoint(...)". Calling these commands directly from VBS will create the loads, the two loading definitions will appear in the session file, and the two events will be separately undoable, however there will be nothing to tie these events to the pedestrian load dialog. Additionally the session file created will be an automatically generated one, and although it will contain the same information, it will not be precisely what was entered. It would also probably be desirable to have undo remove both loads, rather than one at a time. If instead, the dialog calls <code> IFModeller.createUndoableEvent("db.IFDatabase.createLoadingConcentrated(...):db.IFDatabase.createLoadingConcentrated(...), "db.IFDatabase.deleteAttribute(...):db.IFDatabase.deleteAttribute(...)", "Create Pedestrian Load") </code> this gives LUSAS Modeller all the information necessary to create an undo-able event. Not only will it create the loads, but the creations will appear in the session file using precisely the given commands, and using the label "Create Pedestrian Load". The events will be undo-able and redo-able together, again, using the label "Create Pedestrian Load"
 Note that this system is similar to that described in IFDatabase.beginCommandBatch. The advantage of IFDatabase.beginCommandBatch is that the necessary commands are captured automatically by Modeller. The advantage of IFModeller.createUndoableEvent is that cosmetic events such as rotations, selections, and colour changes can also be specified. 
		Params:
			command (str): Snippet of VBScript to execute to do and redo the event

"Wall clock time" counts minutes and seconds as seen by a clock on the wall,  and times will therefore be slower if the PC has many other tasks running. Conversely, clock ticks measure only CPU time and ignore time taken by other processes, interaction with disk, etc. The number of clock ticks taken by an operation should be relatively consistent between runs, regardless of what else the PC is doing. However, since it ignores interaction with the disk, it can be misleading. Unfortunately, Windows does not provide a mechanism to measure how long an application took, including disk access but excluding other applications. Can be called repeatedly (in other words, calling wallClockEnd() resets the start time). If “filename” parameter is not given: times are written only to the text output window. If “filename” parameter is given:     a tmg file is created (unless it already exists) and is opened for writing. In all situations, a new line of text in the following format will be created and added to the text output window (and optionally to the given file): <S> seconds of elapsed time, to 3 decimal places

			label (str): label to identify the task
