# Python Examples

This folder contains Python scripts that interact with LUSAS creating model features or accessing analysis results.

It is recommended that beginners start from the `Jupyter Notebook` folder, with contains a plethora of examples in a friendly Notebook framework of Python blocks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting up Python on Windows

You can first **check if Python is already installed** on your system through one of the following methods:

1. **Using Command Prompt**:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd` and press Enter (this opens the command prompt)
   - Type `python --version` or `python -V` and press Enter
   - If Python is installed, you'll see the version number (like "Python 3.10.5")
   - You can also try `py --version` as an alternative
2. **From the Start Menu**:
   - Search for "Python" in your Start menu
   - If Python is installed, you should see it listed

To **install Python** on your system, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**:
   
   - Download the latest Python installer from [python.org](https://python.org)
   
   - During installation, make sure to **check "Add Python to PATH"**
   
   - Complete the installation process

2. Install required Python **libraries**:
   
   - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd` and press Enter (this opens the command prompt)
   
   - To install **pywin32**, run:
     
     ```bash
     pip install pywin32
     ```
   
   - Optionally, additional Python libraries used across the repository examples can be installed running:
     
     ```bash
     pip install pandas openpyxl matplotlib
     ```

If you are using *Visual Studio Code* as your (IDE), it is recommended that you also install the `Python` and `Pylance` plugin (released by *Microsoft*).

## üöÄ How to Run

Python can be executed in the traditional way, outside LUSAS, or similarly to *VBScripts*, through the Main Menu shortcut "Run Script".

The examples in this directory assume that Python will connect on LUSAS externally. The connection will be established through the Component Object Model (COM) system, similarly to connecting on other software like MS Excel. A Python script can be run externally with the following CMD command: 

```bash
cd LUSAS-API-Examples/python/
python create_beam_model.py
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Script Shortcuts in LUSAS (toolbar button, menu item)

You can add your scripts in LUSAS toolbar or menu through the following steps.

**Toolbar button**:
1. Within LUSAS, navigate to the menu View > Toolbars.
2. Under the `User` tab, you can define up to 9 commands where you can call you python script file with the following command:
```VBScript
' With command prompt shown
CreateObject("WScript.Shell").Run "py C:\\path_to_my_script\myScript.py"
' Or with command prompt hidden
CreateObject("WScript.Shell").Run "py C:\\path_to_my_script\myScript.py", 0, true
```
3. Go back to the `Commands` tab and select `User` from the Categories list, and Drag & Drop one of the user buttons in one of the existing toolbars, then close the window.
4. You can edit the button icon by right clicking the toolbar button and selecting Button Appearance. Alternatively, you can modify the default user button icons by editing the following image `C:\\Path_to_my_lusas_installation\Programs\Config\userToolbar.bmp`.

**Menu item**:
1. Navigate to `%userprofile%\Documents\Lusas211\UserScripts` and edit the `UserMenu.vbs` or create a new if it does not exist.
2. This script should modify the LUSAS menu and the code should look like the following example:
```VBScript
$ENGINE=VBSCRIPT

' Create a user menu to host all menu entries
set myMenu = menu.appendMenu("User Menu")
' Create a new menu item
call myMenu.appendItem("My script (cmp shown)", "CreateObject(""WScript.Shell"").Run ""py C:\\path_to_my_script\myScript.py"" " )
call myMenu.appendItem("My script (cmp hidden)", "CreateObject(""WScript.Shell"").Run ""py C:\\path_to_my_script\myScript.py"", 0, true" )
```

## üîçüêõ Troubleshooting

1. Command prompt error `python: command not found` or `The term 'python' is not recognized`

   These error will be thrown in CMD or PowerShell when the python installation path is not in the Windows `PATH`. To solve this, follow these steps:
   - In the Windows search bar, type python 3, right-click on it and select `Open file location` and do the same on the highlighted file (e.g. `Python 3.10 (32-bit)`). You should not see the `python.exe`.
   - Copy the path of the open explorer window and close it
   - On your desktop, right click on `This PC` and select `Properties`, find and click the `Advanced system settings` link to open the System Properties.
   - In the open window, click on `Environment Variables...`, and under the User Variables, select the `Path` variable and click edit.
   - In the open window, click `new` and paste the copied python path.
   - Click OK on all windows to close them.
   - Now you should be able to run python commands in the the command prompt.

2. Python error `AttributeError: module 'win32com.gen_py.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' has not attribute 'CLSIDToClassMap'`

   First, ensure that you are using the LPI_21_1.py library and that the object at the error line has the called method.
   Python is case sensitive which may sometimes cause issues with pywin32. These issues are usually fixed my deleting the pywin32 cache. To do so, follow these steps:
   - Navigate to `%TEMP%/gen_py` and open the python version folder (e.g. 3.12)
   - Delete the folder that matches the error message `XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`
   - Run the script again.

3. Casting

   Some LPI commands will return the general object types which may require casting to access fully access them. As an example, getting a loadcase object can be done through the `getLoadsetByName()` command which will return an `IFLoadset` object. If you are sure that this object is a loadcase, you can cast it as an `IFLoadcase` object using the command `win32.CastTo(myLoadset, "IFLoadcase")`. This is also done when accessing attributes through the `getAttribute()` LPI command, as seen at the end of the `06b_Getting_Results_PRW.py` example where a Print Results Wizard is acquired and then cast to `IFPrintResultsWizard`.
